Before building the web app, clone the master and gh-pages branches separately as follows.

    git clone https://github.com/prideout/pageturn.git pageturn_source
    git clone -b gh-pages https://github.com/prideout/pageturn.git pageturn_public
    cd pageturn_source
    yarn install
    yarn build
    cd ../pageturn_public
    npx http-server

The master branch contains only the source code, while gh-pages contains resource files and the
output of the build.
